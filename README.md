## How to Build

1. install Qt5, Boost and PhysX
   Or you can download from here[TBA]

   **for all platforms:**
   1.1 Download and install Qt5 SDK from https://www.qt.io. My choice is version [5.8.0](http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.8/5.8.0/qt-opensource-mac-x64-clang-5.8.0.dmg).

   1.2 Download and install PhysX SDK from https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk.
   You may get source on GitHub and compile by yourself. Current version is 3.3.

   **for windows:**
   1.3 download and install Clang ( http://releases.llvm.org/download.html -> Clang for Windows (64-bit))



2. install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (version 3.0.0 or later is required)

3. â€‹

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yushroom/FishEngine.git
   ```

4. Use CMake to generate project file
   If you have set path to boost and Qt:

   ```shell
   cd FishEngine/Engine
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" ..
   ```

   Or you can use camke-gui.
